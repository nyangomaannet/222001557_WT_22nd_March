                Talent management is the process of attracting,
                 developing, and retaining skilled employees to
                  meet current and future business needs. 
                  It involves identifying key positions within an organization,
                   assessing the skills and potential of employees, and implementing
                    strategies to develop and retain talent. Talent management aims to 
                    ensure that the right people are in the right roles at the right 
                    time to drive organizational success. This process includes
                     activities such as recruiting top talent, providing training
                      and development opportunities, and creating a positive work 
                      environment that fosters employee engagement and retention.
                       Talent management is crucial for organizations to maintain
                        a competitive advantage and achieve long-term success.
